            <img class="child-1-img-sep" src="https://cdn.glitch.com/4cf8338f-582d-410a-9a1b-78d34fab1fec%2Fdont_bend.jpg?v=1624814200615" alt="Top Image">

Apart from risking your immediate temple worthiness and eternal salvation by breaking this important law, there are good reasons why you shouldn’t try to push the boundaries. Do you want to know what exactly is appropriate when you are dating before marriage? Can you handle the truth? Yes, you can handle the truth. Read the “Sexual Purity” section in “Standards for Youth” and commit to follow all of the instructions therein.  Explain these boundaries in detail, so there is no confusion. That’s always fun and it makes some people uncomfortable, which is hilarious. Also, good rule of thumb, never do anything with another person that you wouldn’t feel comfortable doing in front of your parents. One good reason to not bend the rules is because adding “extra” physicality to a relationship can unnaturally lengthen the duration of a relationship. This wasted time in a dead-end relationship could be better spent dating other people and honing one’s social skills. Talking about, and especially adhering to this rule communicates to the people you date that you have self respect and that you respect the people you date, too.</p>
          
            
          
          
          <!--Rule # 5-->
          
          <h3 class="child-2-title">Be a 100%-er Rule</h3>

Be brave and adventurous.  Be willing to go on at least one date with others.  This commitment towards dating serves two purposes.  First, guys will be more apt to ask you out on a date if they know that, barring a scheduling conflict, you will say “yes.” Furthermore, you will hopefully be dating more often, and a larger variety of people, thereby accelerating the rate at which you can hone your social skills and better identify the qualities you look for in a future spouse.</p>
          
          <!--Rule # 6-->
          <h3 class="child-3-title">No-relationship-decisions-after-midnight Rule</h3>
          <p class="child-3-img-parent">

Why are you even out on a date this late?  Actually, you are probably NOT on a date...why are you hanging out so late?  Don’t you know that nothing good happens after midnight?  The same goes for relationship decisions.  Make those decisions with a clear mind in the daytime… not during the heat of some sleep deprived moment in the dark somewhere.</p>

          
          <!--Rule # 7-->
          
          <h3 class="child-4-title">Share the rules!</h3>

This helps people respect your standards. Sharing these rules allows you to communicate with your actions. Sharing the rules help people understand what messages you are trying to convey.  
People won’t know what you are trying to communicate to them with your actions and adherence to these rules, unless they know the rules you adhere to. These rules help you have a prolific dating career. Understanding these rules and explaining them to the people you (might) date will reduce unneeded stress and anxiety in your life.  Could even increase the amount of dates you go on. Helps you communicate the right messages to the people you date.</p>
          
          <h3 class="these-rules-title">These rules:</h3>
          <p class="these-rules-1">Have been developed over years and years of dating to try to maximize fun, help people communicate, and reduce some of the stress that comes with dating and relationships.</p> 
          <p class="these-rules-2">Are funny and a little provocative.  It’s fun to tell people one of the rules, and watch them recoil with disgust, only to have them later acknowledge the rule’s wisdom and purpose after you explain it to them.</p>

          <p class="these-rules-3">Are so good, we should actually charge money for them.</p>
