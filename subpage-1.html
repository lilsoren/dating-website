Well, you can’t just spring this rule on someone while you’re on that third date. You have to have already communicated this rule well before that date. The purpose of this rule is to help with communication. Ladies, a guy doesn’t usually ask out a girl three times unless he likes her and is interested in dating her exclusively. A little kiss at the end of a third date tells him he’s on the right track and you like him too and are interested in possibly moving toward a relationship. HOWEVER, you are not obligated to accept a third date with this guy. In fact, if you have decided that he’s just a friend after the second date you have options. You don't have to kiss them, you don't have to go on any more dates with them, or you can clarify that you just want to go dutch(pay for yourslef). These counters to the traditional third date signal that you are not interested in pursuing a romantic or an exclusive relationship with him, WITHOUT pretending like you’re too busy to date.  Don’t ever pretend that you’re too busy to date.

          <h3 class="child-2-title child-title"> 3 Strike Rule</h3>

            <img class="child-2-img-sep"  src="https://cdn.glitch.com/4cf8338f-582d-410a-9a1b-78d34fab1fec%2F3_strike_rule.jpg?v=1624739662117" alt="Middle Image">

Look, she doesn’t want to date you. Maybe she gives you valid sounding reasons and says she wants to go out some other time.  Well, she’s probably lying because she doesn’t want to hurt your feelings.  She’s trying to let you down easy.  Don’t sweat it.  Her rejection is not a reflection of your worth.  Just take a hint and let her go.  Don’t ask her out any more.  Girls have a lot of angst over this kind of stuff.  If they could wave a magic wand, then all of the “hot” guys would ask them out, and the rest of the guys would steer clear.  Girls wish you would just read their minds, but following this rule is the next best thing.  Girls: what if you decline a date, but it really was due to a scheduling conflict?  And what if you really, truly wouldn’t mind going out with him?  Unlike baseball, you can erase strikes against you.  How? By immediately countering his date invitation (which you rejected) with a proposed alternate time and venue for the date.  If you weren’t able to counter at that moment, you could alternatively invite him on a date that you plan.  It doesn’t mean that he’ll ask you out in the future, but at least you have properly conveyed your gratitude for his initial invitation on a date.</p>
          <!--Rule # 3-->
          <h3 class="child-3-title child-title">3.5 Second Rule</h3>
          <p class="child-3-img-parent">
            <img class="child-3-img-sep" src="https://cdn.glitch.com/4cf8338f-582d-410a-9a1b-78d34fab1fec%2F3.5_second_rule.jpg?v=1624813087486" alt="Bottom Image">

There is no mistaking a kiss that is at least 3.5 seconds.  That is plenty long enough to establish that the kiss is mutual and that you both like each other enough to eschew dating other people and commit to each other for at least a short time.  Anything less and there may be disagreement as to whether or not you are in a committed relationship.  In fact, you are probably just hoping your companion is as committed to exclusivity as you. In reality, you are probably in some form of “serious” relationship, which does not automatically commit either of you to exclusivity.  You would either need to have an actual conversation and agree to expectations of exclusivity, or invoke the 3.5 second rule (the unspoken route) to enter an exclusive relationship.</p>
